Compact Academic CV

Original description:
This curriculum vitae template has been designed for an academic CV. The current structure provides a summary of academic history without going in-depth on any one constituent part but the template can be modified to include more information if required. More important sections are at the start of the CV while publication and teaching history is left for the end. Within each section all entries are clearly sorted by date.

Important note: this template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX. There should be a setting in your LaTeX distribution to change to XeLaTeX. This template (by default) uses the Linux Libertine font which is freely available at www.linuxlibertine.org. You will need to install this font for the template to compile. The template also contains the option to use the Hoefler Text font which comes bundled with Apple OS X, see the template for a description on how to use this font. Previews for both fonts can be found below.
